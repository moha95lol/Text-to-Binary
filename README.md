# Text-to-Binary
To import this I would recomend writing this:

from tbe import Encrypt

instead of:

import tbe



To encrypt on character write:
character = input()

Encrypt.character(character)

 
 
To encrypt a word write:

word = input()

Encypt.word(word)


Unfortunately, you can't encrypt a sentance, to do that you would have to use the Encypt.word() many times because to deal with spaces was a big migraine.
